For help W.Avy get this information, we create a basic statistical analysis of the temperatures on Oahu during the months of June and December. This is to help determine whether or not the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.  For this wqe write a query for get average, maximum and minimum temperatures for June and December.

## Summary: 
Our analysis shows that the weather is approximately stable throughout the year. It is hot enough most of the time. This means that this location is good for opening such a business as a surf shop.
But for a more accurate analysis, it would be necessary to make another request for the most active stations to track more deeply the weather conditions in this location.

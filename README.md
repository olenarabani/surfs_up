## Summary: 
Our analysis shows that the weather is approximately stable throughout the year. It is hot enough most of the time. This means that this location is good for opening such a business as a surf shop.

But for a more accurate analysis, it would be necessary to make another request for the most active stations to track more deeply the weather conditions in this location.
